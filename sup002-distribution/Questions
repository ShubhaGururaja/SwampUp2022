- How the data gets created in the attendees instances 
- what if the data is not present and workaround for it ?
- used maven and npm for release bundle - do we need to add more like docker images or helm charts 
- how edge nodes gets created ? what are the names for it so the queries will work 
- Does identity tokens work for distribution ? Can we ask attendees to use API keys as they are going to get deprecrated ?
- Any naming convention to be followed for the artifacts ? I have bunch of hello worlds
